# Titanic-survival-prediction-project-Logistic-Regression
Predicting passengers survival in the titanic incident using Logistic Regression.
In this project, I did data preprocessing, handled null data, data analysis and visualization. Based on the observations, I used **Logistic Regression** and build a model which can predict the titanic survival based on different features like fare, sex, age, pclass etc. This model has **78% accuracy score, 79% precision and 78% recall.**
